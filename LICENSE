A fork of the Irrlicht 3D Engine is included in this repository.
Please note: The Irrlicht 3D Engine is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group. This means that if you use the Irrlicht Engine in your product, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the IJG code, unless of course you recompile the engine without support for JPEG images. It would also be nice to mention that you use the Irrlicht Engine, the zlib and libpng. See the README files in the respective folders for further information.



For all other components (if not otherwise covered by a (compatible) license in the comments of the respective file) the following license (the same as the Irrlicht Engine License with replaced author) applies:
